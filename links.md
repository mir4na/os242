  --- The video provides an introduction to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), explaining its structure and key components. It highlights the differences between the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and AES, focusing on aspects such as operation modes, the number of rounds, and key scheduling processes. Additionally, the video introduces the various transformations used in AES and discusses the parameters of AES, emphasizing the relationship between key size and the number of rounds required for encryption. This provides a foundational understanding of how AES operates compared to older encryption methods like DES.

#### Week 3

* [How To Enlarge / Increase a Virtual Machine’s Disk Size in VirtualBox - Windows](https://youtu.be/n1YOlMlU-dg?si=_OKHjiUgcDm1bTzb)
